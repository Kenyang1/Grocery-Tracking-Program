# Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program

## Project Summary  
This project involves creating an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer as part of my role as a junior software engineer. The program solves the problem of analyzing text records to determine the frequency of purchased items. Users can search for a specific item to see how many times it appears in the list, display all items and their frequencies, or view the frequencies as a histogram. If an item is not found, the program informs the user. Additionally, the program provides an option to exit the application gracefully.  

## Key Accomplishments  
### What I Did Well  
I excelled at implementing file reading and writing operations. By revisiting the readings for a refresher, I was able to understand the logic and translate it effectively into the program. Iâ€™m particularly proud of utilizing the map data structure, which simplified the task of tracking and counting item frequencies. Although initially challenging, with some practice and additional learning, I became confident in using maps, and they now feel intuitive.  

## Areas for Improvement  
### Enhancing the Code  
One area for enhancement is error handling. For example, I could improve the program's robustness by incorporating `try` and `catch` blocks when validating user input.  

### Benefits of Improvements  
These enhancements would prevent potential crashes caused by invalid input and keep the program running in a continuous loop until the user provides valid input. This would improve the user experience and make the program more secure and reliable.  

## Challenges and Solutions  
The most challenging part of this project was working with maps. Before this project, I had limited knowledge of how to implement them. To overcome this, I referred to Zybooks for examples and worked on practice problems during my free time. These efforts helped me understand the concept and implement it successfully in my program.  

## Transferable Skills  
The knowledge I gained about maps and their application in counting occurrences will be particularly useful in future projects or coursework. Understanding how to use this data structure efficiently will allow me to tackle similar problems in a streamlined manner.  

## Maintaining Code Quality  
To ensure the program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable:  
- I utilized consistent white spacing to improve readability.  
- Inline comments throughout the code provide clarity on the purpose of each section or function.  
- Naming conventions were followed to make the code intuitive for others to understand and modify.
